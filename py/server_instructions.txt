once tcp server is running:
	
	how to communicate with server:
		identifier bytes == <10 random bytes generated when client is initialized>
		message = tuple(<command:string>, <arguments:tuple>, <keyword arguments:dict>)
		
		*json encode message
		*join identifier bytes and message bytes together in that order
		*send bytes to server
		*receive a json back
		*decode json to an object
		

examples:
	1. client sends message: ("help", None, None)
		object_out is a string, that shows available commands
		
	2. client sends message: ("help", ("uptime",), None)
		object_out is a string, that displays how to use the command
		
	3. client sends message: ("uptime", None, None)
		object_out is a integer, that is the server uptime in milliseconds

	command					description
	--------------------------------------------------------
	model_start				| start a model with arguments: point, x_mapping, y_mapping, z_mapping
	model_state				| get current step, points and normals from the server
	model_step_next			| progress the model forward by 1 or more steps at a time
	model_step_goto 		| model will either progress or restart to reach a specific step
	model_step_redo			| model will recalculate the last progress with config changes applied
	model_hausdorff 		| get previous step's hausdorff distances relative to current step
	model_get_config		| get current configuration
	model_set_config		| update current configuration using valid keyword arguments
	model_get_const			| get model constants
	model_set_config		| update model constants using valid keyword arguments
	model_save				| save current model state using with name as an argument
	model_load				| load saved model state using with name as an argument
	model_delete			| delete current model (will delete saved states as well)
	model_expire			| delete current model after given amount of minutes has passed
	alg_solve_string		| solve a formula using values in the keyword arguments
	alg_derivate_string		| get a formulas derivative form using arguments ("x*2+z", "x")
	alg_hausdorff_distance	| get the hausdorff distance between points1 and points2
